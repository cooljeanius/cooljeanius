### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Creating a repository with the same name as your own username will allow you to have a README displayed on your own GitHub profile page, too!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [legislating](https://github.com/cooljeanius/legislation), [Battle for Wesnoth campaigns](https://github.com/topics/wesnoth-campaign), [porting FOSS Unix-y stuff to Macs](https://github.com/stars/cooljeanius/lists/macports-related), trying to make [PureDarwin](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin) a thing, trying to fix [bugs](https://github.com/cooljeanius/gcc_bugs) in [GCC](https://github.com/cooljeanius/gcc/tree/me/autotools-tinkering) so it can help me be a better programmer, and other misc. stuff.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why contributing to FOSS is good politics!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter: [@cooljeanius](https://twitter.com/cooljeanius)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: there's no "h" in my spelling of "Gallager" (despite most spellcheckers assuming otherwise).
- Sponsor me! https://github.com/sponsors/cooljeanius
- Also note that I dislike emojis and didn't add the ones in this README myself; I just declined to remove the ones GitHub had already left entered by default for me, because my laziness overpowers my disdain for emojis.
