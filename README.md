### Hi there 👋

Creating a repository with the same name as your own username will allow you to have a README displayed on your own GitHub profile page, too!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [legislating](https://github.com/cooljeanius/legislation), [Battle for Wesnoth campaigns](https://github.com/topics/wesnoth-campaign), [porting FOSS Unix-y stuff to Macs](https://github.com/stars/cooljeanius/lists/macports-related), trying to make [PureDarwin](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin) a thing, trying to fix [bugs](https://github.com/cooljeanius/gcc_bugs) in [GCC](https://github.com/cooljeanius/gcc/tree/me/autotools-tinkering) so it can help me be a better programmer, imagining an [alternative Constitution](https://github.com/cooljeanius/w_Constitution), and other misc. stuff.

- I like copyleft! If I forgot to add a license to one of my repos, assume I meant a copyleft one (probably either [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or [GPLv3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)).
- I believe that copyleft should apply to AI training data, too. I only consent to my code being used for training AI models if the code it is used to generate is released under a compatible license; I refuse to consent to allow it to be used for proprietary purposes.
